# DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS FEATURES

## Fault Tolerance
###  - Failure Detection and Recovery
- [ ] Implement a monitoring system to detect node failures and trigger automated recovery processes.
- [ ] Use redundancy and replication to ensure that critical components have multiple instances, so that if one instance fails, others can take over its duties.

###  - Clock Synchronization
- [ ] Implement a clock synchronization protocol to ensure that all nodes have a consistent view of time.
- [ ] Use a common reference time source, such as a time server, to synchronize the clocks. 
#### - - - Clock Synchronization Algorithms
- [ ] Christian's algorithm
- [ ] Berkeley algorithm
- [ ] 
- [ ] 


###  - Consistency
- [ ] Implement consistency protocols to ensure that all nodes have a consistent view of the shared state.
- [ ] Algorithms

###  - Replication Consistency and Concurrency Control
- [ ] Implement replication consistency protocols to ensure that all replicas have consistent data.
- [ ] Use distributed locking and concurrency control mechanisms to ensure that concurrent updates to the shared state do not conflict with each other.

###  - Transparency
- [ ] Implement transparency protocols to hide the distributed nature of the system from users and application developers.

## Load Balancer
### - Load Balancing Algorithms
- [ ] Round-Robin          = This algorithm distributes traffic evenly across a group of servers in a cyclical manner.
- [ ] Least connection     = This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the least number of active connections, thus ensuring that the load is distributed evenly across all the servers.
- [ ] IP-hash              = This algorithm assigns clients to a server based on the client's IP address. This ensures that a particular client is always directed to the same server, which can be useful for maintaining session data.
- [ ] Weighted Round Robin = This algorithm is similar to round-robin, but assigns a weight to each server to handle the requests.
- [ ] Least Response Time  = This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the fastest response time, which ensures that the load is distributed evenly and the client receives a fast response.

### - Dynamic Load Balancing
- [ ] Monitor server response times and dynamically distribute load by redirecting requests to available servers with optimal response times.

## Communication Protocols
###  - Remote Procedure Calls
- [ ] RPC to retrieve information from remote server

###  - Message Passing
- [ ] Using Express

###  - Publish-Subscribe
- [ ] Using Express

## Monitoring
###  - Distributed Tracing
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing in Python with libraries such as OpenTelemetry or Zipkin.

###  - Metrics Collection
- [ ] Use libraries like Prometheus or StatsD to collect metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, etc. from your distributed system.

###  - Log Analysis
- [ ] Use a logging framework such as Python's built-in logging module or log management services like ELK Stack or Splunk to analyze and visualize logs generated by your distributed system, including any bug reports.
- [ ] Bug Reports

###  - Alerting
- [ ] Set up alerting mechanisms to notify the appropriate stakeholders when certain events occur, such as system downtime, high error rates, or other critical incidents. Tools like PagerDuty or Nagios can be used for this purpose.

## Security
### Access Control
- [ ]Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions, such as creating or deleting chat groups.

### Secure Communication Protocols
- [ ] Implement secure communication protocols, such as TLS/SSL, to ensure that communication between the client and server is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.

### Encryption
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption using libraries like Cryptography or PyNaCl to ensure that chat messages cannot be intercepted by unauthorized parties.
