## Load Balancer
### - Load Balancing Algorithms
-         [ ] Round-Robin          = This algorithm distributes traffic evenly across a group of servers in a cyclical manner.
-         [ ] Least connection     = This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the least number of active connections, thus ensuring that the load is distributed evenly across all the servers.
-         [ ] IP-hash              = This algorithm assigns clients to a server based on the client's IP address. This ensures that a particular client is always directed to the same server, which can be useful for maintaining session data.
-         [ ] Weighted Round Robin = This algorithm is similar to round-robin, but assigns a weight to each server to handle the requests.
-         [ ] Least Response Time  = This algorithm directs traffic to the server with the fastest response time, which ensures that the load is distributed evenly and the client receives a fast response.
